# Javafx-based-robot-simulation-application

An interactive Java-based robot simulation demonstrating autonomous movement, collision handling, and object-oriented design.

This project simulates multiple types of robots operating within a 2D arena using JavaFX. Robots move autonomously, interact with obstacles and targets, and exhibit different behaviors such as obstacle avoidance and sensor-based navigation. The simulation runs in real time with a graphical interface.

## Features
- Autonomous robot movement
- Multiple robot behaviors
- Collision detection with walls and obstacles
- Interactive targets
- Real-time JavaFX graphical interface

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX
